# Shader FPS Benchmark - Q-series (Q60)

Baseline performance of every non-audio lighting shader rendered as the panel
theme background on the **HYTE Q60** (MediaTek tb8167, Android 11). This is the
pre-optimization baseline; see the "Optimization" section once the heavy shaders
are simplified.

## Method

- Surface: real `PanelBackgroundShader` (nexus-web) rendered as the Q60 panel
  theme background, clock + monitoring widget composited on top - the actual
  shipped path, not an isolated canvas.
- Q60 viewport: 480×854 CSS px (720×1280 physical ÷ 1.5 devicePixelRatio).
  - **Full res** = 480×854 backing store (`maxDevicePixelRatio: 1`).
  - **Half res** = 240×427 backing store (`maxDevicePixelRatio: 0.5`).
- FPS = browser `requestAnimationFrame` render rate of the shader, averaged over
  a ~3s window per resolution. Android's `gfxinfo`/SurfaceFlinger counters were
  unusable - they report the compositor's fixed vsync (~54), not the canvas's
  real update rate, so the meter counts rAF inside the WebGL render loop.
- The panel tops out at **~54 fps** (shader + React + widgets share the frame
  budget); a shader at ~54 is GPU-idle and free.

### Caveats

- The last 12 shaders (`ferrofluid`→`crystaltunnel`, marked `*`) were measured
  after ~8 min of continuous cycling, by which point the panel frame budget had
  sagged to a ~25 fps ceiling. Their **full-res** ranking is valid; their
  **half-res** figures are understated (true half-res is higher).
- `ribbonflow` was not captured (the poller missed the final frame before the
  run signalled done).

## Reading it

Almost every heavy shader is **fill-rate / per-pixel bound**: half-res roughly
triples or quadruples the rate (watercolor 3→14, fire 11→38, aurora 25→54),
which means the cost is per-pixel work. Simplification levers, in order of
payoff: fewer fbm/noise octaves, fewer raymarch/loop iterations, cheaper
transcendentals (`pow`/`exp`/`length`/`atan`), and smaller kernels.

Worst offenders to simplify first:
**bursts, watercolor, starfield, lightning, nebula, mandelbrot, sandstorm,
bokeh, bubbles, plasmaglobe, starpath, silkwave, fire, domainwarp, jellyfish.**

Shaders pinned at ~54 (solids, plasma, rainbow, matrix, wave, wormhole, …) are
GPU-idle and need no work.
