/// each attribute via Win32 and this only decides. Matches Task Manager's
/// Apps definition, not .NET's own (more permissive) MainWindowHandle
/// heuristic: IsWindowVisible alone still passes DWM-cloaked windows (hidden
/// UWP/background windows, and the common case behind service processes
/// like svchost owning technically-visible windows nobody sees), so cloak
/// state is required, not optional - unless the window covers a whole
/// monitor, which only a fullscreen app does. Likewise a missing title is
/// excluded unless the read itself was blocked (UIPI across an elevation
/// boundary), which a truly titleless background window never trips. The
/// cloak/title/tool-window heuristics all exist to reject windows that are
/// hidden from the user - the current OS foreground window is never one of
/// those by definition, so it bypasses all of them and only the ownership
/// and on-screen-bounds sanity checks still apply.
